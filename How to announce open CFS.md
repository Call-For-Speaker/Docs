# How to announce open CFS

Our main goal is to help speakers find open Calls for speaker, and to help all organizers find speakers. For this goal, we have a [public Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Call4Speakers), where the memebers can announce about open CFS. **All announements are don in the [CFS Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Call4Speakers).**

Don't forget to share with the community any Open Call For Speakers that you hear about (not only events you organize). Help members to find the best opportunities to speak at in the best conferences and events ðŸ˜€

Following the recomendations and tips here can help you gain the goal better.

## ðŸ’¥Please keep the same format for all calls

Using the same format for all Calls For Speakers helps to use API to collect the messages and promote them and it keep the announcements clean.
